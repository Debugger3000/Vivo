# To-do list


# Test Users
 - Tester01


# Run Dev commands
- Client:
    - cd to /Vivo/client/vivo_front

    - How I set up my dev environment:
        - Download emulator packages within android studio
        - Medium Phone API 34
        - In Vs code, 'CTRL + SHIFT + P'
        - Flutter: run emulators, choose to run Emulator of choice
        - Emu should boot up
        - 
        - Then, 'flutter run' in directory above, and app should rip

        - ALTERNATE:
            - launch emulator in vs code like above
            - Use 'F5' to run flutter run in debug, and HOT RELOAD should work

- Server:
    - cd to /Vivo/server
    - run command 'air' (basically nodemon...)
    - go run index.go




# Rules

- Use Snake Case (file_name)

- Don't push broken code
- Test before committing changes

- Front-end changes should be made with android studio
- When changes are made, always PUSH with vscode
